# Research Afternoon

## Your IDE (interactive development environment)
1. Customise your command line to make it pretty and useful (ie. git branch/branch status parser)
2. Create a "workshop", designed to walk the rest of your cohort through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)
3. Coding best practices: indentation, documentation, variable naming

## Accessibility
1. What is semantic HTML - why is it useful?
2. What is ARIA?
3. Refactor one of your team's websites (or one from the rest of your cohort if necessary) to reflect what you've learned
4. How and why to do responsive, mobile-first design?

## DOM manipulation
1. How can you use JavaScript to create an HTML element and then add it to your webpage? How would you replace an existing element with it?
2. What is the difference between using the HTML attribute `onClick()` and using an event handler in javascript?
3. How would you add a `<li>` element to the start of a `<ul>`?
4. What is a JavaScript Event? What does event.preventDefault() do and why might you use it?
5. What is a NodeList? How is it different from an Array?
6. What are the security concerns around `Element.innerHTML` and what could you use instead?

## CSS
1. Modern Approaches to CSS:
  - BEM
  - Atomic CSS
  - CSS in Javascript...
  - Different ways of doing Layout in CSS (Float, Flexbox, Grid)
