## GitHub Scavenger Hunt

From the beginning, Founders & Coders has used GitHub to store both code and curriculum content. By maintaining a _single source of truth,_ we reduce the cognitive overload involved in constantly switching between mediums of communication.

We aim for transparency in the running of the organisation, to enable the greatest level of contribution from our members. In order to get involved, you will need to get acquainted with our GitHub repos.

**Bookmark the following repos**

| Repo | Purpose |
| ---- | --- |
| [`london-programme`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme) or [`nazareth-programme`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme) or [`gaza-programme`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/gaza-programme) | The running of your campus |
| [`hq`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/hq) | The charitable organisation that sets up and supports new campuses |
| [`master-reference`](https://github.com/m4v15/master-reference) | Our curriculum |

On the top right-hand corner of the screen, you will see a bell. If you "watch" a repository, you can use GitHub's in-app notification system for updates. Otherwise your email inbox will get full very quickly.
